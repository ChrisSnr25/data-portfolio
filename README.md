Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my data analysis projects and skills. As a Business Data Analyst with almost 3 years of experience, I am committed to continuously expanding this portfolio with new projects.

## Featured Project: OSD Tech Shop Sales Performance Analysis (March 2025)

This initial project focuses on the sales performance of OSD Tech Shop, a retailer specializing in high-end electronic gadgets and PCs. The analysis covers a one-month period (March 3rd to April 3rd, 2025) and aims to provide a comprehensive overview of key sales metrics, product performance, and customer behavior.

**Key areas explored in this analysis include:**

* Overall Gross Sales and Average Gross Sales

* Performance of different product categories (iPhones, Samsung, JBL, PCs, Smartwatches)
* Trends in customer orders and purchasing patterns
